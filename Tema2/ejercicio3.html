        One Day
        <p>
            Sometimes I lay under the moon and thank God I'm breathing
            Then I pray,    "Don't take me soon, 'cause I am here for a reason"
        </p>
        <p>
            Sometimes in my tears I drown
            But I never let it get me down
            So my negativity surrounds <br>
            I know someday it'll all turn around, because....
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>
                All my life I've been waiting for, I've been praying for <br>
                For the people to say <br> 
                That we don't wanna fight no more, there'll be no more wars <br>
                And our children will play <br>
                One day
            <i/>
