    One Day
    <p>
        Sometimes I lay under the moon and thank God I'm breathing
        Then I pray, "Don't take me soon, 'cause I am here for a reason"
    </p>
    <p>
        Sometimes in my tears I drown
        But I never let it get me down<br>
        So my negativity surrounds
        <strong>I know someday it'll all turn around, because....
    </p>
    <p>
        <i>
            All my life I've been waiting for, I've been praying for <br>
            For the people to say
            That we don't wanna fight no more, there'll be no more wars<br>
            And our children will play
            One day
